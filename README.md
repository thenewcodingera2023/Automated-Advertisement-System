Automated Advertisement Generation System
An advanced platform for automating high-quality audio and video advertisement production using state-of-the-art AI, with seamless integrations for data management and media storage.

üöÄ Overview

The Automated Advertisement Generation System revolutionizes ad production by automating the creation of professional audio and video content. Powered by cutting-edge AI for text-to-speech and speech recognition, it integrates with Airtable for data management and Google Drive for media storage, offering an efficient, scalable solution.
This project demonstrates a powerful combination of performance-optimized C++ and flexible Python, showcasing technical versatility and real-world problem-solving with modern tools.

‚ú® Features

High-Quality Audio Generation: Natural-sounding speech from text using Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow (LibTorch in C++, PyTorch in Python).

Accurate Speech Transcription: Precise audio-to-text conversion with Whisper for automated subtitles (ONNX Runtime in C++, Transformers in Python).

Seamless Media Integration: Combines audio and video with FFmpeg (C++) or MoviePy (Python) for polished ad videos.

Efficient Data Management: Real-time project data handling via Airtable API.

Scalable Storage: Uploads media to Google Drive for reliable storage.

Asynchronous Processing: Scalable task queuing with Redis (C++) and Celery (Python).

API-Driven Workflow: Webhook endpoints for integration with external systems like Airtable.


üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system features a modular, dual-component design for performance and flexibility:

C++ Service: Optimized for speed using Crow (web server), Redis (task queuing), and AI inference with LibTorch (Tacotron 2, WaveGlow) and ONNX Runtime (Whisper). Ideal for resource-constrained environments.

Python Service: Built for rapid development with Flask (web server), Celery (task queuing), and Python libraries like Transformers and MoviePy. Perfect for customization and Python ecosystems.


Both services expose a /webhook endpoint, queue tasks via Redis/Celery, process them with AI and media tools, and update results in Airtable while uploading outputs to Google Drive.

üì¶ Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Redis: Install and run Redis server.

Airtable: Get API key, base ID, and table name.

Google Drive: Set up API credentials with folder access.


C++ Service

Install Dependencies: Crow, Redis++, libcurl, JsonCpp, LibTorch, ONNX Runtime, spdlog, Boost (use apt, brew, or compile from source).

Compile: Use g++ with appropriate include/library paths.

Run: Execute the compiled binary.


Python Service

üéÆ Usage

Trigger the system via the /webhook endpoint with POST requests.
Webhook Payload
{
  "action": "generateAudioVideo",
  "recordId": "rec1234567890"
}

Supported Actions

generateAudioVideo: Generates audio from Airtable text and uploads to Google Drive.

mergeAudioVideo: Merges audio/video, adds subtitles via transcription, and uploads.


Workflow

Send POST request to /webhook with action and record ID.

Task is queued and processed asynchronously.

Check progress/results in Airtable.


üåü Examples

Audio Generation:

Send: {"action": "generateAudioVideo", "recordId": "rec123"}
Output: Audio generated with Tacotron 2/WaveGlow, uploaded to Google Drive, Airtable updated.


Video with Subtitles:

Send: {"action": "mergeAudioVideo", "recordId": "rec123"}
Output: Audio/video merged, subtitles added via Whisper, uploaded, Airtable updated.
